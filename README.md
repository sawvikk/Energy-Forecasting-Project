Hourly Energy Consumption Forecasting ⚡Intermediate Time Series Project | Predicting regional grid load using XGBoost and meteorological data.🎯 Project OverviewThis project forecasts hourly electricity consumption for the PJM East (PJME) region. Unlike basic time series models that only look at historical trends, this model integrates external weather data (Temperature & Humidity) and cyclical temporal features to capture the complex drivers of energy demand.Key Results:Final Model Accuracy: 95.97% (4.03% MAPE)Improvement over Baseline: 55.6% reduction in error compared to the Naive Persistence model.🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, Meteostat (Weather API), MatplotlibValidation: Walk-Forward Time Series Cross-Validation (TimeSeriesSplit)🧬 Feature Engineering (The "Secret Sauce")To move beyond a beginner level, I implemented several advanced feature engineering techniques:Cyclical Encoding: Transformed hour and month into Sine/Cosine components to preserve the temporal relationship (e.g., ensuring hour 23 is recognized as being close to hour 0).Lag Features: Created 24-hour and 7-day lags to allow the model to learn from recent history.Exogenous Variables: Merged hourly weather data (Temperature/Humidity) from the Meteostat API for the Philadelphia region to account for heating/cooling loads.Window Statistics: 24-hour rolling averages for temperature to capture "thermal inertia" effects on the grid.📊 Evaluation & ValidationStandard K-Fold cross-validation is inappropriate for time series. Instead, I used Walk-Forward Validation:Baseline: A 24-hour persistence model (predicting $t$ as $t-24$).Metric: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).Performance Comparison:ModelMAPEImprovementNaive Baseline9.09%-XGBoost (Final)4.03%55.60%📈 VisualizationsThe model demonstrates high fidelity in tracking daily peaks and valleys, especially during high-volatility weather periods.(Note: You can add your exported plot images to a plots/ folder and link them here!)🚀 How to ReproduceClone the repo: git clone https://github.com/sawvikk/Energy-Forecasting-Project.git  Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txtDataset: Download the PJME_hourly.csv from Kaggle and place it in the data/archive/ folder.Run: Open notebooks/PJME_Energy_Forecasting_Analysis.ipynb and run all cells.Future Improvements[ 1 ] Integrate US Public Holiday data to better predict atypical load drops.[ 2 ] Implement Probabilistic Forecasting (Quantile Regression) to provide confidence intervals for grid operators.[ 3 ] Explore Deep Learning architectures like N-BEATS or Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT).
